# What is Polygon Chess?

Polygon Chess is a multiplayer chess game built using socket-io and react, with the chess.js and react-chessboard libraries. It features multiplayer interactivity including custom chat lobby creation, custom game creation, and membership exlcusivity thru the means of requiring the player to mint an NFT before accessing the game. Currently there are 6 NFTS to choose from, and the contract is currently live on the polygon-mumbai test net.
